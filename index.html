        <p>One of the <a href="#" title="Cave diving">divers</a> said to have played a major role in the rescue
            criticized the submarine as amounting to nothing more than a <a href="#" title="Public relations">public
                relations</a> effort with no chance of success, and that Musk "had no conception of what the cave
            passage was like";<sup><a href="#">&#91;190&#93;</a></sup> and said that Musk "can stick his submarine where
            it hurts". Musk reasserted on
            <a href="#" title="Twitter">Twitter</a> that the device would have worked and referred to the diver as "pedo
            guy" without offering any evidence to support the claim, causing backlash against Musk.<sup><a
                    href="#">&#91;191&#93;</a></sup><sup><a href="#">&#91;192&#93;</a></sup> He subsequently deleted the
            tweets, along with an earlier tweet in which he told another critic of the device "Stay tuned jackass".
            <sup><a href="#">&#91;192&#93;</a></sup> On 16 July, the diver stated that he was considering legal action
            in relation to Musk's comments.<sup><a href="#">&#91;193&#93;</a></sup><sup><a

        </p>
        <p>After Musk's Tweets, Tesla shares fell 4% as some investors worried about his erratic behavior.<sup><a
                    href="#">&#91;195&#93;</a></sup> Tesla investors subsequently demanded that Musk apologize.<sup><a
                    href="#">&#91;196&#93;</a></sup> Two days later, Musk issued an apology for his remarks:<sup><a
                    href="#">&#91;197&#93;</a></sup><sup><a href="#">&#91;198&#93;</a></sup> "The fault is mine and mine
            alone"
            <sup><a href="#">&#91;199&#93;</a></sup> and "my words were spoken in anger".<sup><a
                    href="#">&#91;200&#93;</a></sup>
        </p>
        <p>On August 28, 2018, in response to criticism from a writer on Twitter regarding how Musk had handled the
            diver's criticism, Musk circled back to the pedophilia accusation tweeting "You don't think it's strange he
            hasn't sued me? He was offered
            free legal services. &#160;...".<sup><a href="#">&#91;201&#93;</a></sup> The following day, a letter from <a
                href="#" title="L. Lin Wood">L. Lin Wood</a>, the rescuer's attorney, dated August 6, emerged, showing
            that he had been making preparations
            for a libel lawsuit.<sup><a href="#">&#91;202&#93;</a></sup><sup><a href="#">&#91;203&#93;</a></sup>
        </p>
        <p>On 5 September 2018, a reporter from <i><a href="#" title="Buzzfeed News">Buzzfeed News</a></i> published an
            email written by Musk on August 30 marked "off the record", saying "I suggest that you call people you know
            in Thailand, find out what's
            actually going on and stop defending child rapists, you fucking asshole. As for this alleged threat of a
            lawsuit, which magically appeared when I raised the issue ... I fucking hope he sues me." Musk confirmed
            that he had sent the email.
            <sup><a href="#">&#91;204&#93;</a></sup> The diver subsequently filed a defamation suit in Los Angeles
            federal court in mid-September 2018, with plans to also file a similar case in the United Kingdom. The
            lawsuit contends that "Musk embarked
            on a PR campaign to destroy [the diver]'s reputation by publishing false and heinous accusations of
            criminality against him to the public", and seeks upwards of US$75,000 in damages.<sup><a

        <p>Musk first mentioned Teslaquila in an April Fools tweet in 2018.<sup><a href="#">&#91;207&#93;</a></sup> The
            proposed Tesla-branded <a href="#" title="Tequila">tequila</a> become closer to a reality in October 2018 as
            Tesla filed an 'intent to
            use' trademark application with the <a href="#" title="United States Patent and Trademark Office">U.S.
                Patent and
                Trademark Office</a>.<sup><a href="#">&#91;208&#93;</a></sup> The trademark is for distilled agave
            liquor. Musk reaffirmed his intention to release the product with a tweet, featuring a mockup of the bottle,
            on October 12.
            <sup><a href="#">&#91;209&#93;</a></sup>

        <p>Mexico's Tequila Regulatory Council (CRT) has publicly denounced the proposed product, arguing, "If it wants
            to make Teslaquila viable as a tequila it would have to associate itself with an authorized tequila
            producer, comply with certain standards
            and request authorization from Mexico's Industrial Property Institute".<sup><a
